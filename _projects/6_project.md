I designed and built a DC power supply capable of delivering 10 mA at 3 V Â± 0.1 V from a 120 V (RMS) source at 1 kHz. The design of the circuit includes a transformer to step down the voltage, a rectifier to convert the AC to DC, and an RC filter to smooth the output. Depending on the specific requirements, the design may also include a regulator to ensure a stable output voltage.
