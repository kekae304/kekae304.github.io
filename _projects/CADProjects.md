Competing in McMaster's annual SumoBot Competition, my team of three and I designed and built a compact, autonomous robot capable of identifying and pushing opposing robots out of the sumo ring.

    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/SB1.jpg" title="SumoBot" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/SB2.jpg" title="SumoBot" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

Our design drew inspiration from successful bots of the past, incorporating key components such as the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement, the KY-033 line tracking sensor for navigation, and the MX-1508 brushed DC motor driver for efficient motor control.
