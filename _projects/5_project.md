I designed and built a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) featuring three digital input bits, with weights calculated based on the ratio of full-scale analog voltage to the total number of possible digital values. The output voltage is proportional to the sum of the input bits, weighted accordingly. The DAC utilizes a network of transistors and a resistive network, followed by an inverting unity-gain buffer to ensure stable and accurate signal conversion.
