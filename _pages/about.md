Welcome to my page! My name is Erion Keka, and I’m currently a third-year student at McMaster University, enrolled in the Electrical Engineering Co-op program. I’m gaining valuable hands-on experience as an Electrical Engineering Intern at Jitterware. 

Previously, I was a Python Sub-Team member of the IEEE Branch at McMaster University and served as an Engineering Representative for the McMaster Student Union, the largest student body at McMaster. 

With this experience, I’m excited to be launching my own technical club at McMaster, McMaster RoboSub, which will compete in an exciting underwater robotics competition. I’ll be documenting my journey through the 'Blog' section of my page. Furthermore, in my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and working out.
